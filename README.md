# airgap_vulnchat
Threw this together in about an hour, some good ol' cursed code. this is supposed to be a slightly forgetful chat client. The extra vulns are just for fun.

## Requirements
1. Python2
2. Uses UDP
3. Uses MSSQL


I did not do #3 because MSSQL on python2 is a bit of a pain, and I didn't want to set up system ODBC
